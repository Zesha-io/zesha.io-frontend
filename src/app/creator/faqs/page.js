                                With Zesha, content creators can upload their
                                original videos and start earning from the first
                                view. To support this, ads are embedded in the
                                video, and earnings from these ads are split
                                between the creator (70%), Zesha (20%), and
                                viewers (10%). Zesha also provides monetization
                                tools for content creators to earn directly from
                                their loyal fans and followers.
